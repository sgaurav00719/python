    "<h3>Why Do We Use Object-Oriented Programming?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Organization and Structure**:\n",
    "   - **Classes and objects** allow for logical grouping of related data and functions, making code more organized, understandable, and manageable.\n",
    "   - It promotes a clear structure, making it easier to map real-world entities to software components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - **Encapsulation** helps in hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through well-defined interfaces (methods).\n",
    "   - It prevents external code from being able to directly modify the object’s state, avoiding unintended interference and misuse of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reusability**:\n",
    "   - **Inheritance** allows a class to use methods and properties of another class, promoting reusability.\n",
    "   - Reusing existing components and functionality can significantly reduce development time and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - OOP makes software more modular, allowing functionality to be easily extended or modified.\n",
    "   - New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code, reducing the risk of introducing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - **Abstraction** allows programmers to hide the complex implementation details and show only the necessary features of an object.\n",
    "   - It simplifies programming by exposing only high-level actions the object can do, making it easier to develop and maintain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "   - **Polymorphism** allows one interface to be used for different data types, enabling the same operation to behave differently on different classes.\n",
    "   - It provides flexibility and the ability to extend functionality in a system designed with interface compatibility in mind."
